# Fish Colors
It is fork of https://github.com/emilyploszaj/fish-colors with little changes:
- Buckets for 22 main tropical fish only. There is a problem with the same textures for several fish, as they have the same coloration, but different patterns. I don't know how to solve it :(
- Migrate from Chime to Optifine/CIT Resewn

## Building
* Build with dub.
* Have `in/fish.png` in the folder where the program is ran (this is the case by default).
* Get the generated resource pack in the `out/` folder
